Description:


This module is used to mass configure APC Power Distribution Units (PDU).

The config file is downloaded (via ftp) and stored in 'configs/<ip>.ini' file. The 
config can then be parsed, modified, stored and sent back to the respective PDU.
    
Take care that after the config file is written, it should not be updated on the remote 
PDU system for a few minutes, as the PDU seems to randomly scan for changed configs 
and apply them at varying rates. There is not much information available on how this 
works from APC.

Usage examples are included in example.py.  

This is the python port (with a few changes) of the orignial php code written by 
Kevin O'Connor <kjoconnor@gmail.com>

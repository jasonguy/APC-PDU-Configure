This class allows you to mass configure APC PDUs.  It requires a writeable 'configs/' directory where the class downloads
configs to while they're being worked on.  After you write the config, it may not be updated on the remote system for a few
minutes, as the PDU seems to randomly scan for changed configs and apply them at varying rates.  There's not much information
available on how this works from APC.

Usage examples are included in example.php.  This probably isn't all as clean as it could be, so if you want to make any
changes even if they're just code cleanup I'd welcome it.
